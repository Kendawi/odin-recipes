Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."

        <li>White rum: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
